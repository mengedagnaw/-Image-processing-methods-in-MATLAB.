Digital Image Processing for Material Analysis:
This repository contains two MATLAB projects developed for a course on digital image processing. Each project demonstrates the application of fundamental image processing techniques to solve specific problems in material science: automated fracture detection in rock samples and quantitative microstructural analysis of ironstone.
